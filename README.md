A collection of my solutions to various exercises on https://exercism.io/

I use this website when learning a new language. The site features exercises of various difficulties, there are mentors who approve solutions and provide feedback. I've found the mentorship very useful when learning a new language as they do a great job of explaining some of the intricacies of the language. Having this insight alongside feedback to a practical problem that you've just solved is great because it gives you a concrete use case to think back to in future.
